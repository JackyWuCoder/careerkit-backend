			Research and practice are crucial to preparing for technical interviews. A few things to consider include:
			- Stay informed about the latest trends and advancements in the industry. This knowledge can be valuable when discussing potential solutions during the interview.
			- Ensure you have a solid understanding of fundamental concepts related to the technical skills required in the role you’re applying for. Brush up on core principles and theories – these might be tested during the interview.
			- Practice solving technical problems related to the role. Explore using online platforms, participating in coding challenges, or working on projects that mirror the work you might encounter in the role you’re applying for.
			- Take part in mock technical interviews with peers or trusted members of your network or with a Career Strategist at the BCC—book a Mock Interview coaching & advising appointment on COOL. This helps simulate the interview environment, allowing you to articulate your thought process and receive constructive feedback

			Behavioural questions require you to tell a story from past experiences to demonstrate how you managed a particular situation. Employers ask these questions to assess how you might act in similar situations in the future.
			For example, behavioural questions could be: “Tell me about a time when you had to juggle multiple priorities at once. How did you handle it?” or “Describe a scenario where you had to work with a team to get a job done?” or “Can you recall a time when you had to work through a customer/client complaint?”.
			Answer behavioural-based questions by using the STAR formula:
			- Situation: Provide background on the scenario, with enough detail for the interviewer to imagine you in the situation.
			- Task: The task you had to complete or the problem you faced
			- Action: The steps you took to deal with the task or problem
			- Result: The impact of your work. Was the problem solved? How did others react? What feedback did you get?
			When using the STAR formula in interviews, the most substantive section of your answer should be the ‘Action.’ Employers want to hear about how you’ve solved problems in the past and what steps you took.
			Aim to use at least three action verbs when describing the steps you took to deal with the task or problem in your interview examples. And make sure you finish the example by explaining your work's result or impact

			Some interview questions may come as a surprise and are best to prepare for in advance. For example, it’s not unusual for interviewers to ask questions to try to get to know a candidate on a deeper level than their professional achievements. Be prepared for questions such as:
			"Tell us about something that is not on your resume," or "What achievement are you most proud of outside of work?"
			Take time to prepare a couple of anecdotes for these types of questions which you feel comfortable describing in an interview setting. These don’t have to be related to the post you’re applying for, but it’s not bad if they are.

			You should have some questions ready to ask the employer at the end of an interview. This demonstrates your preparation and interest and will help you determine whether you and the organization/position are a good fit.
			- Preface questions with research to show you’ve done your homework, e.g., "In a recent press release, you discussed your commitment to re-design your product life-cycle to suit triple-bottom-line sustainability principles. What inspired this decision?"
			- Help your interviewers visualize you in the job, e.g., "How would you rate this position in terms of personal and professional development?"
			- Bring your personality and make it personal if the situation allows it. e.g., "I noticed in your LinkedIn profile that you are a golfer. What’s your favourite course to play?"; or, "I noticed on LinkedIn that you have worked at this company for eight years. What aspects of the working culture do you enjoy most?"
