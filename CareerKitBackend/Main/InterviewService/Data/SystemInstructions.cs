			Example Interview Answer:
			During a group project, a teammate and I disagreed on the direction of our presentation. Instead of letting tension build, I suggested we sit down and compare our ideas objectively. We combined the best parts of both approaches, which improved the final result and strengthened our collaboration.

			Example Output:
			- Try to be more specific about the scenario you are presenting
			- It would be stronger to mention how the solution impacted the relationship or outcome of the project
			- Lacks self reflection on what was learned or how your approach was changed
