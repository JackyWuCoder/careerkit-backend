			Do your research - Show an employer that you’re well-prepared and interested in the job

			Be compelling - Find strategies for writing a compelling cover letter
			Keep it short: Recruiters and hiring managers spend only seconds looking at cover letters. Make yours easy to read and keep it to one page.
			Use clear and specific language: If you can replace the name of the company and the sentence still makes sense, you aren’t being specific enough. The below sentences make sense with both company names, which means they aren’t specific enough:
			“I’m extremely passionate about the potential to work with a well-respected company like BDO.”
			“I’m extremely passionate about the potential to work with a well-respected company like O2E Brands.”
			Use keywords: These are the words and phrases in the job posting related to the skills, abilities, and training the employer seeks. Using keywords will help your cover letter get past Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

			Also, check out our GenAI section below for more tips on identifying and using keywords in your cover letter.
			Start with a hook: Begin the first paragraph with a story, anecdote, quote, or saying that draws the reader in so they want to read more.
			Note: some finance roles don’t want a hook, so consider being direct with an opening sentence like: “I am interested in ___ position at ___ company.”
			Showcase some personality: If your cover letter demonstrates some of your personality, it’ll help you stand out. There are many ways to do this: tone, vocabulary, and great storytelling. But research the company beforehand to ensure you’re being appropriately professional.
			Consider writing a first draft that’s absolutely wild to help get your ideas out. Check out the article, How to Write a Cover Letter and Not Hate the Process (Morning Brew)
			Focus on your strengths: As the article, Dear Job Seekers: Stop Apologizing for the Experience You Don't Have (The Muse) explains, instead of drawing attention to your weaknesses, focus on your existing skills. For example, you don’t need to apologize for only having one year of experience when the job description asks for two.

			Draw in the reader - Get the reader interested in what you have to say from the first paragraph
			Include the hiring manager’s name. Never use generic greetings such as “To Whom It May Concern” or “Dear Sir or Madam.” Instead, use the name of the person reading your cover letter. If you’ve tried and have been unsuccessful in finding out who to address your letter to, explore the article, 7 Ways to Address Your Cover Letter That Aren't ‘To Whom It May Concern’ (The Muse).
			Start your opening paragraph with one or two engaging and enthusiastic sentences, perhaps a personal story, question, or anecdote that directly applies to the position—opening sentences “hook” the employer so they want to read further.
			The rest of the first paragraph is your chance to describe why:
			You want the job based on your interests and experiences
			You’re a good fit for the organization based on shared values, company culture, etc.

			Tell your story - Use the STAR framework to tell the best possible stories about your past work experiences
			For cover letters, we recommend using the STAR method to craft relevant accomplishment statements that are concise and will have an impact. The STAR method includes the following:
			S What was the situation? Be specific: a job, club, group, class, etc.?
			T What was your task? Did you improve something? Did you solve a problem?
			A What concrete action did you take? What did you personally do? What skills did you use?
			R What was the result? How did your organization benefit from your actions? Ideally, results are quantitative: Increased participation by 20%, increased revenue by $2000
			Results can also be qualitative: Promoted to a supervisor role, received positive client feedback.
			These are specific, relevant, and personal stories about your past experiences. Presenting your examples this way gives you more storytelling opportunities and can add your unique voice to your cover letter. It’s still crucial that most of your examples focus on the Action portion of the STAR method. You should also aim to use three action verbs per example.

			Finish strong - Summarize your capabilities, interest, and fit
			Your closing paragraph summarizes the key messages from your cover letter and distills your message down to just a couple of sentences. Your closing paragraph lets you:
			Remind the employer of your specific interest in the job
			Restate your skills (using different wording helps)
			Reaffirm your enthusiasm for the role and the organization
			Include a call to action inviting the employer to follow up with you directly
			Include a call to action inviting the employer to follow up with you directly
